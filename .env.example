.env.example
This file outlines the environment variables required to run the Node.js Express API.
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and copy these variables into it, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials and settings.

Required Variables
MONGO_URI:

Your MongoDB connection string. This is typically obtained from MongoDB Atlas or your local MongoDB setup.

Example: MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.akx03ss.mongodb.net/productsDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

IMPORTANT: Ensure you replace <username> and <password> with your actual database user credentials and verify the database name (productsDB in this example) is correct.

NODE_ENV:

Specifies the environment the application is running in. This affects error logging and detail level.

Recommended values:

development: For local development. Enables detailed error messages and stack traces.

production: For deployment. Provides generic error messages to clients to avoid leaking sensitive information.

Example: NODE_ENV=development
